# Maze-Solving-Robot
This work is done for eYantra Robotics Competition 2020-21 for the theme Nirikshak bot


This 3D model is built on Coppeliasim. A given image of a maze is generated on the modelled platform with the help of Lua scripts and Image processing techniques.
Then, a starting and ending position of the ball is given as input. The maze is encoded as a 2D array using basic image processing techniques. The shortest path is found using BFS algorithm. The ball is guided through the path by actuation of the 4 servo motors on which the platform is mounted.
